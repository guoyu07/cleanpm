# cleanpm
A small project to clean npm_modules folders under a certain directory and all its sub-directories.

# How to Use
1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Run `npm start [directory]` where the 'directory' parameter is required. It can be either relative or absolute path.
3. Wait...for a long time if the directory to clean is huge
